This assignment aims to give you hands-on practice with PySpark programming in EMR.

Launch an EMR cluster as instructed by lab 6â€™s manual. Choose to install both Hadoop and Spark on the cluster. 

Then SSH into the master node, and run the following script to prepare the data.

```shell
#!/bin/bash

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinjiajia/datafiles/main/soc-LiveJournal1Adj.txt
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinjiajia/datafiles/main/tiny_social_data.txt

hadoop fs -mkdir /input
hadoop fs -put soc-LiveJournal1Adj.txt /input
hadoop fs -put tiny_social_data.txt /input
hadoop fs -df -h /input
hadoop fs -ls /input
```

Betweem the 2 datasets, the [*soc-LiveJournal1Adj.txt*](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-LiveJournal1.html) dataset represents the social network structure of LiveJournal users as an adjacency list. Unlike mutual friendships in Assignment 1, LiveJournal allows one-way friendship declarations - user A can declare user B as a friend without requiring B to reciprocate.

Despite this directional nature, our recommendation approach remains unaffected: If two users appear together in the declaration lists of many other users, they are likely to be friends and we should remcommend them to declare each other as friends.

**Implementation Note**:

For simplicity, you may still recommend these pairs even if one user has already declared the other as a friend (no need to filter out existing one-way connections).

[*tiny_social_data.txt*](https://github.com/justinjiajia/datafiles/blob/main/tiny_social_data.txt) stores a tiny portion of this dataset:

```
46133
46134    46069,46079,46105
46136
46148    46046,46096
46149    46046
49949    46058,49896,49936,49952,49955,49957,49960,49963,49979
46163    46062,46126
46160    46069
46157    46073,46093,46070
46156    46077
46152    46112
46140    2915
46141
46145
46150
46151    46068
46154
46161    46075
46162
46164
46168    46165,46167,46176,46178,46175
46169    46165,46170,46221
46173    46165,46170,46171,46172,46174,46176,46177,46179,46180,46194,46195,46207
46174    46165,46173,46177,46179,46180
46175    46165,46168,46176,46178,46221
```


So, the format of a record is as follows:

```
user_id <tab> friend1_id,friend2_id,friend3_id, ...
```

The record

```
46134    46069,46079,46105
```
means user 46134 has declared 3 friends. 


Note that there're users who haven't declare any friends. There are also users who have declared only one friend. They all should be dropped from subsequent processing.
